/*! \page LCI_1.7_log Development log for LCI v1.7
## TODO List:
- rename symbols: `LCI_*` for export symbols, `LCII_*` for internal symbols, `LCIU_*` for utility.
- replace all memory operations with LCIU_* memory operations.

## Decisions to be made
- `const` or `#define` or `enum`: which to use? Libfabric, MPICH, and Argobots both use `#define`. Why?
